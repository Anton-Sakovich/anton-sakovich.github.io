## Anton Sakovich

### Background and Education

* Bachelor of Science in Physics (with honors), *Belarusian State University* (2016)
* Master of Science in Physics, *Graduate School of National Academy of Sciences of Belarus* (2017)

My specialization is *theoretical physics*, which involves a lot of complex computer modeling nowadays. I enjoy computer modeling and have been creating different models in
[Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) for more than eight years. Among my works are:

- Implementation of a quasi-local iterative non-linear optimization algorithm
involving large numeric data processing in the framework of “All solid-state super-twinning photon microscope” project of European Framework Programme [Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020) ([SUPERTWIN](http://www.supertwin.eu/)).
- Numerical simulation of evolution of a high-dimensional open bosonic quantum system via quantum trajectories averaging in the framework of “Sub-Poissonian Photon Gun by Coherent
Diffusive Photonics” [Quantum Flagship](https://qt.eu/) project of European Commission ([PhoG](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~phog/)).

Now I am working at [B.I. Stepanov Institute of Physics](http://ifan.basnet.by/), where I have been working since I graduated from the university in 2016. My main activity is
developing models for international projects our laboratory is now engaged in. I like collaborating on international projects because I have found that people from the western
world and eastern world can often complement each other in solving various tasks. Although I have never taken any official English exam, I have successfully completed Streamline's C1 level course and can travel and communicate with my colleagues abroad with ease.

Besides Wolfram Language, I have some experience in C#, which I use when I need extreme efficiency and Wolfram Language cannot deliver it for some reason.

### Interests

In a nutshell, I adore modeling things. My interests shifted from physics to programming when I realized that it didn't really matter to me what to model, it was modeling itself that I liked.
Thus, my current aim is to learn programming from *programmers' viewpoint*, for I think programmers have achieved a lot of success in building efficient strategies of modeling things, what
making a program is about. Then, I would like to leave physics completely and devote myself to the process of modeling itself.
